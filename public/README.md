## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **npm** (v9+)
- A valid **API key** for Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT-4

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scholarship-Finder.git
   cd Scholarship-Finder
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a file named .env in the project root:

env
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
Ensure the .gitignore file includes the .env file:

bash
Copy
Edit
.env
node_modules/
Install Dependencies:

Edit
Act as a scholarship advisor with 10+ years of experience. Recommend 3 scholarship opportunities matching the student's profile. Include:
1. Scholarship Name
2. Eligibility Requirements
3. Award Amount
4. Application Deadline

User Prompt Template:

text

Edit
Student Profile:
Name: {name}
Field: {field}
Interests: {interests}
This ensures that your AI returns consistent, clear, and formatted recommendations.

⚙️ API Integration & Security
Secure API Key:
The API key is stored in the .env file and is used only on the backend (in server.js), ensuring it isn’t exposed to the frontend.

Backend Proxy:
Your Node.js/Express server securely handles requests to the LLM API, protecting your sensitive data.

📢 Deployment & Collaboration
Version Control:
Uploading your project to GitHub enables you to track changes, collaborate with others, and showcase your work.

Live Deployment:
For static hosting of the frontend, consider using GitHub Pages. For full-stack apps, services like Heroku or Vercel are excellent options.
